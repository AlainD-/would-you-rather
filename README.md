# Would You Rather?

This is a version of the famous "Would you rather" game. You need to sign in in order to play.

A player is asked a question which he/she can choose between 2 choices. The player has to choose only 1 of the 2 choices. Every answer is definitive.

Every player can propose a new question to the rest of the community.

The leader board section list the top ranking players based on the number of the question they answered, and the number of questions they submitted.
The more questions a player answers and/or submits, the higher score he/she gets in the leader board.

Will _YOU_ be able to reach the top 3? **Let's play!**

## Important information

* This project is read-only.
* This project is part of the nano degree program "React" from [Udacity](https://udacity.com).
* The objective of this project was to demonstrate my skills to implement an interactive application in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), using [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux) and [React-Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) as a global state management.
* Asynchronous dispatches are performed with the usage of the [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) middleware
* [React-router](https://reactrouter.com/web) is also used in this project to handle the different views and sections of this application
* The whole application has been built initially with React version `17.0.2` and uses in its original state only functional components and react hooks.
* Most of the UI components come from [PrimeReact](https://www.primefaces.org/primereact/) version `6.5.1` and [PrimeFlex](https://www.primefaces.org/primeflex) version `3.0.1`
