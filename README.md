# Would You Rather?

This is a version of the famous "Would you rather" game. You need to sign in in order to play.

A player is asked a question which he/she can choose between 2 choices. The player has to choose only 1 of the 2 choices. Every answer is definitive.

Every player can propose a new question to the rest of the community.

The leader board section list the top ranking players based on the number of the question they answered, and the number of questions they submitted.
The more questions a player answers and/or submits, the higher score he/she gets in the leader board.

Will _YOU_ be able to reach the top 3? **Let's play!**
